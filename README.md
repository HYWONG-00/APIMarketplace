# APIMarketplace

**This is my final year project in university**


The project involves offering various API plans to customers. The code is available in the "customer_web" folder, while "admin_web" is designed for administrators to manage the APIs.


For this project, I used React as the frontend framework, and Appwrite as the backend server.
